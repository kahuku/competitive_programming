## Mock Interviews
This is where you'll spend the majority of your time as a TA for this class. You'll be conducting mock interviews with students, giving them feedback, and helping them improve their interviewing skills. 

**You are qualified to do this job**

Some TAs have reached out to me before concerned that they're not "interviewing the right way," or that they're not "qualified" to be conducting mock interviews. I want to assure you that you are. You don't need to be an expert in the field to help students improve their interviewing skills. You just need to be able to ask good questions, give good feedback, and be encouraging. In real interviews, I've had all kinds of interviewers with different personalities and interview styles. Some were very technical, some were very casual, some were very formal. The students need to be prepared for all kinds of interviewers, so it's good for them to get a variety of interview experiences. So, don't worry about "doing it right." Know that you bring value to the students just by being there and helping them practice.

**Choosing a problem**

I try to ask the students questions that relate to a recent topic we've covered in class. As I've done Leetcode problems, I've added them to an organized list I can use as a "question bank." I try to have ~3 questions prepared for each topic so that I can be sure to ask the student a question they haven't seen before. I suggest that as you go through Leetcode problems, you create your own list of problems you're comfortable with and can ask the students.

**Conducting the interview**

Traditionally, the TAs in this class have used [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to schedule mock interviews. I've typically done mine in person in the TMCB basement (back of room 1066) with a whiteboard, because I like to give the students a variety of interview experiences. However, most TAs have done their online over Zoom, which is also a great option since that's becoming more common in the industry, and gives the students more flexibility. It's good to have a mix of interview styles available. When doing interviews over Zoom, there are two main ways to give the student a coding problem: 1) send them a link to a Leetcode problem and have them share their screen as they code, or 2) use a shared code editor like [CodeShare](https://codeshare.io/) and explain the problem verbally. Again, the students need to be prepared for any kind of interview, so the variety is good.

A typical interview might go like this:
- 2-3 minutes to introduce yourself and get to know the student or catch up since the last time you met
- 2-3 minutes to explain the problem, give examples, and answer any questions the student has about the problem
- 20 minutes for the student to solve the problem
- 5 minutes at the end to discuss the solution and give feedback

A few assorted tips:
- Be encouraging. The students are nervous, and they need to know that you're on their side and want them to succeed.
- Get to know them. Ask them about their background, their interests, their career goals, etc. This will help you give more personalized feedback and help them feel more comfortable.
- I like to not share the constraints of the problem (how large input can get, etc.) until the student asks for them. This is more realistic to a real interview, where you have to ask clarifying questions to get all the information you need, and it's a good habit for the students to get into early.
- If the student is stuck, you can give them hints or ask them questions to help them get unstuck. You can also ask them to explain their thought process to you, which can help them see where they're going wrong.
- If the student finishes the problem quickly, you can ask them to optimize it, or ask them a follow-up question like adding additional constraints or complexities. This gets easier as you do more problems and get a feel for what kinds of follow-up questions are appropriate.
- **Have the student think out loud**. This is the most important part of the interview. You need to know what the student is thinking so you can help them when they get stuck. If they're silent, you can't help them. If they're talking, you can guide them in the right direction. The same applies to a real interview. If you're silent, the interviewer doesn't get to learn about the way you think, which is often more important than the solution itself. While they're coding, have them explain their thought process and why they're making the decisions they're making, what their code is doing, etc.

**Giving feedback**

Focus on the positives. What did the students do well? Let them know so they can get into the habit of doing it consistently. Then, give them constructive feedback on what they can improve. Be specific. Don't just say "you need to improve your problem-solving skills." Say "you need to practice breaking down the problem into smaller parts before you start coding." This gives them something concrete to work on. If you can, give them a specific example of a time they did something well or poorly. This helps them see what you're talking about and gives them a concrete example to work from.

Most common points of feedback I give:
- **Clarifying questions**: Make sure you understand the problem before you start coding. Ask clarifying questions if you need to.
- **Thinking out loud**: Make sure you're explaining your thought process to the interviewer. This helps them help you when you get stuck.
- **Edge cases**: Make sure you're considering edge cases and constraints of the problem.
- **Optimization**: Once you have a working solution, think about how you can make it better. Can you make it faster? Use less memory? Handle more complex inputs?
- **Communication**: Make sure you're communicating clearly with the interviewer. If you're stuck, let them know. If you have an idea, share it. If you're not sure about something, ask.
